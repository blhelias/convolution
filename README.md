# Convolution Neurals Network (ConvNets)

Implement simple operations to understand how ConvNets work. 

TODO:
* Implement Loss class
* Implement Optimizer class
* Layer class:
  * Implement Fully Connected (FC) Layers
  * Try to optimize convolution operation
  * Implement backward step for convolution and pooling
